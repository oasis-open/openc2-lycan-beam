this directory is for an erlang implementation of haha

this is a baby step towards making OpenC2 interfaces for cloud vm's.

Two different erlang implementations were created.
Haha (put in hotlink) is a more typical implementation.
Hahax1 (x for experiment so this is first experiment) uses erlang's "let it crash" to implement haha in 1/3 the code at the expense of only giving one error code for all the different errors.
