Https Api Helloworld Actuator (HAHA)
is a very simple actuator that is conformant with 
the OpenC2 Language Specification but
does no actual security functions.
It has a Custom Actuator Profile (CAP)
and will respond to the query openc2 command
with it's profile and schema.
It also responds to a custom query extension
"query whatareyou" with "hello world" - but that is all it does.

this readme needs work
